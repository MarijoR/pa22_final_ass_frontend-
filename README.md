- this frontend for a DEX was done by following the figment polkadot AMM tutorial.
- some adjustments on the frontend were made (simplification)
- frontend was done in reactjs
- testing was done with talisman wallet (and it works)

As for the final assigment frontend was not really focus didnt put too much effort to improve it. I guess it should be enough how it looks currently.
